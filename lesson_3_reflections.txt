When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When multiple users want to work in the same repository.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Pulling changes manually ensures that no conflicted copies arise without my knowledge.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- Forks are used to clone a repository online, from someone else to my own account.
- Clones are used to clone a repository from an online source to a local area, or within the local area.
- Branches are used to test features, or add something experimental without breaking everything.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Being able to fast-forward merge?


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I'd use dropbox. What makes this method easier is that I would never need to work with any version control details, but if I ever do, this would become extremely tedious.
